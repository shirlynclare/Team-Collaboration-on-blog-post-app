    <p>The origin of video gaming traces back to the mid-20th century, with the emergence of early computing technologies. One of the earliest instances of interactive electronic entertainment was the Cathode Ray Tube Amusement Device, created by physicist Thomas T. Goldsmith Jr. and engineer Estle Ray Mann in 1947. This device allowed players to control a dot on the screen and interact with targets displayed on the cathode ray tube. </p> <br>

    However, it was not until the 1960s and 1970s that video gaming as we know it today began to take shape. In 1962, MIT student Steve Russell developed Spacewar!, a space combat video game played on a DEC PDP-1 minicomputer. It became immensely popular among computer enthusiasts and laid the groundwork for future video game development. </p>

    The true catalyst for the video game industry's growth was the release of Pong in 1972 by Atari, founded by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney. Pong, a simple table tennis simulation, became the first commercially successful arcade video game and sparked a wave of interest in electronic entertainment. Its success led to the proliferation of arcades across the United States and paved the way for the home console market. </p> <br>

        Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, video gaming continued to evolve rapidly, with advancements in graphics, gameplay mechanics, and storytelling. The introduction of iconic franchises like Super Mario, The Legend of Zelda, and Sonic the Hedgehog captured the imaginations of players worldwide and solidified video gaming as a dominant form of entertainment. </p><img src="/img/Retro.png" alt="Classic Retro games" class="side-image"> <br>

        <h2>BUT ARENT GAMES A PURE WASTE OF TIME??</h2>
       <section class="explanation"> <div class="paragraph-with-image">
        <p>The Answer to this Lies on the individual. <br>
        
        One might argue that it takes up someones time which could be used doing constructive work and while this may be largely correct, it's not entirely true. <br>
                
        As the saying goes, "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy". The reason for many who are involved in video games to do so is mainly because it serves as rest after a long day or a short break after a cumbersome session of work <br>
        
        This can also be due to professional reasons; Gamers who take video games as a full-time work opportunity thus are wholly devoted to honing their skills behind a screen, be it on  a pc, a console or even a phone <br>
        
        On the other hand, some people are simply lazy and lack the will to do any physical or mental work and thus resort to games to pass time.</p>
