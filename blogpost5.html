    <h1>DESERTS ARE FASCINATING DON'T YOU THINK?</h1>

        <h2>What is a desert?</h2>
        <p>
            Simply put, a desert is any large, extremely dry area of land with sparse vegetation. <br>
            A semi-desert on the other hand is an arid area that has some of the characteristics of a desert but has greater annual precipitation. <br>

            These barren areas may seem terrible at first but upon further consideration, one can really see the beauty of these landforms. <br>
        </p>

        <h2>Well then, What are these beautiful things?</h2>
        <p>
            Take a look at this picture
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="/img/beautides.jpg" alt="Look at that beautiful desert">
        </figure>
        <p> If that doesn't scream beautiful to you, then I don't know what is <br>
        I mean, have you ever seen an oasis? No? Don't worry I got you!</p><br>

            But as we all know, "There can be no good without bad" ~ I think.  <br>
            No one would like living in the desert; It's unbearably hot, there is scarcely any water, The Temperatures are unbelievably low at night and there are life risking factors such as some desert snakes or even sand storms. <br>
            Not to mention that it would be awkward if you were to lose your direction and way back from where you came from (The desert's dunes are pretty symmetrical and similar) <br>

        </p>

        <p>
            As much as we would all love site-seeing deserts, None of us would like to live in one. We should all thus do our part to prevent desertification in Arid areas. <br>
            <h4>How to do this?</h4> <br>
            I suppose you could simply wake up one morning and simply decide that you would like to plant a tree - that would help a lot.
