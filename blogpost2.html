        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>400g of puff pastry, </li>
            <li>500g sausage meat </li>
            <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried sage</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 egg, beaten (for egg wash)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <p><em>Preheat Oven:</em> Preheat your oven to 200Â°C and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</p>
        <p><em>Prepare Filling:</em> In a mixing bowl, combine the sausage meat, chopped onion, minced garlic, dried thyme, dried sage, salt, and pepper. Mix well until all ingredients are evenly distributed.</p>
        <p><em>Roll Out Pastry:</em> Roll out the puff pastry on a lightly floured surface into a rectangle about 0.5cm thick.</p>
        <p><em>Shape Rolls:</em> Cut the pastry into smaller rectangles, about 10cm x 15cm each. Spoon a portion of the sausage mixture onto one side of each rectangle, leaving a border around the edges.</p>
        <p><em>Roll and Seal:</em> Roll the pastry over the sausage mixture, enclosing it completely. Press the edges to seal, and place the rolls seam-side down on the prepared baking sheet.</p>
        <p><em>Egg Wash:</em> Brush the tops of the sausage rolls with beaten egg. This will give them a golden brown color when baked.</p>
        <p><em>Bake:</em> Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the sausage rolls are puffed up and golden brown.</p>
        <p><em>Serve:</em> Once baked, remove the sausage rolls from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes before serving. Enjoy them warm or at room temperature with your favorite dipping sauce or condiment.</p>
